        <div id="line2"> DUKE SOLINUS <br>
                        Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
                        I am not partial to infringe our laws:
                        The enmity and discord which of late
                        Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
                        To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
                        Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
                        Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
                        Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
                        For, since the mortal and intestine jars
                        'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
                        It hath in solemn synods been decreed
                        Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
                        To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
                        If any born at Ephesus be seen
                        At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
                        Again: if any Syracusian born
                        Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
                        His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
                        Unless a thousand marks be levied,
                        To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
                        Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
                        Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
                        Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.  </div><br>
        <div id="line3"> AEGEON <br>
                        Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
                        My woes end likewise with the evening sun.   </div><br>
        <div id="line3">DUKE SOLINUS  <br>
                        Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
                        Why thou departed'st from thy native home
                        And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus. </div><br>
        <div id="line4"> AEGEON <br>
                        A heavier task could not have been imposed
                        Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
                        Yet, that the world may witness that my end
                        Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
                        I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
                        In Syracusa was I born, and wed
                        Unto a woman, happy but for me,
                        And by me, had not our hap been bad.</div>
        <div id="line5"> With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
                        By prosperous voyages I often made
                        To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
                        And the great care of goods at random left
                        Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
                        From whom my absence was not six months old
                        Before herself, almost at fainting under
                        The pleasing punishment that women bear,
                        Had made provision for her following me
                        And soon and safe arrived where I was. </div>
        <div id="line6">There had she not been long, but she became
                        A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
                        And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
                        As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
                        That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
                        A meaner woman was delivered
                        Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
                        Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
                        I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
                        My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
                        Made daily motions for our home return:
                        Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
                        We came aboard. </div>
        <div id="line7">A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
                        Before the always wind-obeying deep
                        Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
                        But longer did we not retain much hope;
                        For what obscured light the heavens did grant
                        Did but convey unto our fearful minds
                        A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
                        Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
                        Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
                        Weeping before for what she saw must come,
                        And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
                        That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
                        Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</div>
        <div id="line8">And this it was, for other means was none:
                        The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
                        And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
                        My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
                        Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
                        Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
                        To him one of the other twins was bound,
                        Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</div>
        <div id="line9">The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
                        Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
                        Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
                        And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
                        Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
                        At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
                        Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
                        And by the benefit of his wished light,
                        The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
                        Two ships from far making amain to us,
                        Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
                        But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
                        Gather the sequel by that went before.</div>
